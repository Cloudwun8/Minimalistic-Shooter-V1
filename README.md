Minimalistic Shooter V1 is the first public version of (hopefully) a series of Minimalistic Arcade Shooters that will be released.

This version currently includes 7 powerups, being sideShot, piercing, fireRate, autoShoot, bigBullet, oneUp, and shield.
These powerups are dropped upon killing enemies and have a 12% chance of appearing. Powerups look like colored squares that you need to touch to activate.
7 different enemy types exist, with a few being more annoying than others

Final boss (above) apears when you reach a score of 100.

Minimalistic Shooter is made to be a game that is able to run on 60fps+ most devices that use WebGL, no matter how low end the device is.
If this game is lagging your device, it might be time to save up for a new one.



PLANNED FEATURES:

A mobile version of the game!

More Enemies: Smart Drones, Splitters, Shielded Enemies, Chargers, Cloaked Units, Snipers, and maybe more...

Smart Drones: Dodge unpredictably, forcing players to track movement instead of just aiming straight.

Splitters: Break into 2–3 smaller enemies when killed.

Shielded Enemies: Destory their shield before they start taking damage.

Chargers: Rush at player after a short "wind-up"

Snipers: Long-range beam telegraph + instant shot.

Cloaked Enemies: Turn visible only when attacking.

Player Upgrade System: Upgrades being worked on for Drones, Offensive, Defensive, and Utility Powerups.

Drones: Drones planned are CT-B (Basic Buddy drone, Does nothing), CR-1 (assault drone), MT-1 (medical drone, heals 3 hearts every wave). Each Drone can be upgraded with meta, like +1 damage for CR class and +1 heart regen for MT class.

Offensive Upgrades: Upgrades like Triple Shot, Piercing Bullets, Explosive Bullets, Homing Micro Bullets, and Charge Shot are planned.

Defensive Upgrades: Upgrades like Dash, Shield, Auto slowdown near enemies, and temporary bullet time after damage are planned.

Utility: Passiveish upgrades like Magnet, Temporal Clones (delayed afterimages that shoot), and Auto Turret are planned.

Shop: Purchase Stuff you need like player upgrades, diffent ammo types, overclocks, drones, and powerups every wave start, or save up for cosmetics if you want to waste your meta.

Meta Progression: Unlockable Characters with different movement speed, bullet style, and passive ability and permanent upgrades per run like Max HP, Fire rate, Damage, and Drone slots.

Overclocks: Overclocks make you immortal for a short period of time. More Overclock types to be also added, but are currently in the drafting phase.

Economy: Currency will be called Meta.
Killing a enemy will give you 1 Meta, the ingame currency. Meta will be used in the shop and maybe more. Killing a boss will give 10 Meta.

Bosses: Bosses will appear every 6 waves. Diffent bosses fights like The Eye (follows player with giant lazer sweeps), Fracture Core (with different phases that slowly breaks into more smaller cores), The Worm (Segmented enemy and moves around and will be difficult to shoot), and The Time Eater (slows and speeds up time)

Difficulty: Difficulties will be something that will be added to the menu before starting a wave. Modes will be Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, and HACKER (jk about that last one)
Game speed, enemy spawn rate, and enemy bullet logic will be changed for each difficulty. Current game plays like how I expect normal will.

Tuned Difficulty/Loot/Progression: Higher Difficulty=More Meta

Buffed Visual Effects: Chromatic Damage Effect and optimised parallax for star background planned.

Full Wave System: Structured waves, with wave types like Spiral Spawns, Circle Collapse, Enemy Rain, And Maze like Walls. Every 6 waves will be a boss fight.

Challenges: One hit death, no upgrades, slow shooting, yeah, it's gonna suck. At least you can choose which one to do, or do ALL challenges at once.
